## This is the creation of the special offers, blog, and contact us pages. All are made to link to one another and be responsive.


Our objectives for this particular webpage were to:

Practice how to make your site responsive.

Create 3 new pages using the established format of header and footer from previous projects.

Use previously learned methods in new ways to replicate these final 3 pages

I made these webpages by creating a basic format, and then using that as the base for all of these pages. Then, I first did the special offers page by creating a large div for the first special offer, and then I duplicated it and changed the information to be correct. Next, I took a similar approach on the blog page as well. I finally used the input box format from the home page to create the contact us boxes.
